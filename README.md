# file-backup-rotate

TLDR Summary: Backup a file when it has changed and rotate the backups.

So I have this habit of playing [FTL: Faster Than Light](https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html), which is fun and fantastic!

But recently I lost some progress because my profile got corrupted.  I was able to get an old save from Apple's Time Machine file history backups, but I didn't want to start playing again until I had a way to ensure that there would be a history of backups created as I play the game.

Also I wanted a reason to get hands-on with GoLang again.  

Thus it came to pass that I created software for something that could have been easily solved with plan old gnu tools and maybe some Bash scripting.  No regrets.  This was a fun bit of coding that I wanted to do for my own selfish reasons.
